       " 'fulltext': \"The internet has transformed the world over the last two decades, but it has also introduced new challenges, and legislation has not kept up. This week Parliament will discuss new rules for harmful content online with both tech companies and some of their staunchest critics. While there will no doubt be differing views, we should all agree on one thing: the tech industry needs regulation.At Facebook, we’ve advocated for democratic governments to set new rules for the internet on areas like harmful content, privacy, data and elections, because we believe that businesses like ours should not be making these decisions on our own. The UK is one of the countries leading the way with wide-ranging proposals on everything from hate speech to child safety and, while we won’t agree with all the details, we’re pleased the Online Safety Bill is moving forward.I spent more than a decade as a criminal prosecutor in the US before joining Facebook, and for the past nine years I’ve helped our company develop its rules on what is and isn't allowed on our platforms. These policies seek to protect people from harm while also protecting freedom of expression. Our team includes former prosecutors, law enforcement officers, counter-terrorism specialists, teachers and child safety advocates, and we work with hundreds of independent experts around the world to help us get the balance right. While people often disagree about exactly where to draw the line, government regulation can establish standards all companies should meet.Companies should also be judged on how their rules are enforced. Three years ago, we began publishing figures on how we deal with harmful content, including the amount of it people actually see and how much we take down. Just like financial results that we are held accountable for, these reports are now published every quarter and we’re subjecting them to independent audit. Once Parliament passes the Online Safety Bill, Ofcom will ensure all tech companies are held to account.Contrary to claims that have been made about Facebook recently, we’ve always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites. People don’t want to see it when they use our apps and advertisers don’t want their ads next to it. That’s why we’ve invested $13 billion on safety and security since 2016 and have more than 40,000 people working in this area. As a result, we’ve almost halved the amount of hate speech people see on Facebook over the last three quarters – down to 0.05 per cent of content views, or around 5 views per every 10,000. We’ve also got better at detecting it. Of the hate speech we removed, we found 97 per cent before anyone reported it to us – up from just 23 per cent a few years ago. While we have further to go, the enforcement reports show that we are making progress.We also make progress by conducting research, including taking part in more than 400 peer-reviewed studies in the past year. This helps us to make our apps better for the people who use them. Contrary to recent claims, our research doesn't conclude that Instagram is inherently bad for teenagers. While some teens told us Instagram made them feel worse when they were struggling with issues like loneliness, anxiety and sadness, more teens told us that Instagram made them feel better when experiencing these same issues. But if even one young person feels worse, that’s one too many, so we use our research to understand bad experiences and prevent them.For example, we now make new accounts private or “friends only” by default for under 18s and direct anyone searching about topics like eating disorders to local organisations who can offer support. We’ve also introduced new tools to prevent abusive messages from reaching people and are building new features like “take a break” that will encourage people to limit the time they spend on our apps.We know there is more to do and we’ll keep making improvements. With new rules for the whole industry we can make the internet safer while keeping the vast social and economic benefits it brings.\"}"
