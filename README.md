## Project Structure

This section provides a detailed overview of the project's directory and file structure, explaining the purpose and contents of each part.

### `webscraping/`

- Scripts designed to extract data from the web, facilitating the data collection process for analysis. They can be viewed as an inspiration for future webscrapping, as they will be very hard to use again. 

### `src/`

- The source code for the core functionality of the project.
  
  - [`src/Processing/`](src/Processing/): All the functions linked use to filter texts on the theme of BigTechs, and text cleaning functions. The `clean()` function is called many times in the project in order to clean uniformally newcoming texts.

  - [`src/GloVe/`](src/GloVe/): 
    - [`glove_functs.py`](src/GloVe/glove_functs.py) contains the main functions to perform the computation of the cooccurrence matric then the training of the GloVe model.
    - [`weights.py`](src/GloVe/weights.py) contains the functions to compute the weighting of embeddings inside a document in order to get the document general embedding.

### `processing/`

- Scripts and modules responsible for data processing and manipulation.
  - `demo_and_requirements/`: Includes scripts showcasing processing capabilities and additional requirements if applicable.

### `notebooks/`

- Contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate or test various features of the project.
  - `main.ipynb`: A notebook that provides a comprehensive demo of the project's capabilities.

### `plots/`

- This directory houses all graphical outputs generated by the project. It includes:
  - `Polarization/`: Subdirectory containing plots specific to polarization studies or results.
